Observations:
1.CacheView was a little too abstract concept for me at first. I'd rather include it's functionality into Cache class itself.
2.I struggled with choosing best fitting data structure for given problem. Eventually I found out Vector structure which suits well in 
my opinion.
3.As a small improvement I would consider checking if requested item already exists in Cache. If so, cache returns it immediately. This 
approach may save execution of a few lines of code I think.
